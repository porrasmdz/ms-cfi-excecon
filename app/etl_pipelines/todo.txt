My ETL classes and pipelines
need to:


===BASIC===
0. Apply functions to tables
0.1. Make Joins
0.2. Apply filters, sort, order asc/desc  [DONE]
0.3. Apply functions to a set or subset of data
0.4. Group By tables and (optionally apply functions to grouped data)
0.5. Fusion datasets (UNION, UNION ALL)
===DATA ANLYSIS===
1. Summarize data by using group bys, functions to set or subset and counting (Roll-Up analysis, Going up levels)
2. Summarize Data with stat functions like mean, count, median, min, max, mode or other stats tools
3. Need The ability to drill down or see "the reverse" of aggregated reports (Drill-Down analysis, Going down levels)
4. Before aggregating or querying I should be capable of selecting a base dataset from set or subset
5. Data Slicing (selecting specific columns, rows or datasets)
6. Group By attributes
7. Pivoting tables or data

===Probably can occur on client======
*1. Attribute aggregation techniques?
*1.1. Weighted aggregation
